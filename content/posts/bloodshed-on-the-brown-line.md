# The Game

Bloodshed on the Brown Line is a classic mystery involving the death of a business mogul with the suspects all present inside a train car.

While most train murder mystery parties expect the players to be stationary, this murder mystery is designed to be played on an actual moving train. While instructions here will call out specific trains and stations (traveling on the Brown "L" from Chicago into The Loop), for all intents and purposes the same premise can be extended on other transit vehicles given the following criteria:

- The trip lasts a minimum 45 minutes each way.
- The vehicle can accommodate groups of 3-4 individuals
- Talking is allowed in the vehicle
- Players are allowed to switch seats after boarding (ideally, when stopped at a station)

If these criteria cannot be met, it is suggested to play the same premise at-home as you would a normal murder mystery.

## Requirements

This game is intended to be played by 9-13 individuals, with an additional player (or players) operating as the Game Master. It will be played out in 2 acts with an intermission, expecting ~2-3 hours to be completed.

Since this game involves boarding an active train, timing is crucial. Schedule kickoff well before the train leaves (suggested 45 min) so that your players are well informed, make the train, and get the best seats to play successfully.

The characters listed are written so that they can be played by anyone, but be sure to assign players based on their comfort level with portraying particular relationships or personality types.

This game involves adult themes such as drugs, adultery, and murder. It should not be played by children or those sensitive to these topics.

## Materials

Attached to this page is a PDF document containing all you need to run the murder mystery successfully. It includes detailed documentation on what to provide to your guests and when to provide it, including suggested lines on how to progress the story between the acts.

Prior to the game starting, you'll want to send the players their Act 1 Sheet and the Player List. This can be done digitally.

You'll want the following physical materials for the game:

- Act 1 Player Packet, 1x per character
  - The Player Act 1 Sheet(s)
  - The Player List
  - A Pencil
  - A Notecard with their character, and goal, and space to complete their objective.
  - A nametag with their character name on it.
- Act 2 Player Packet, 1x per character
  - The Player Act 2 Sheet
  - A Notecard with their name and spaces to vote for best actor, best costume, and murderer accusation
- Prizes, either in the form of a certificate or physical handout

## Tips & Tricks for Hosting

- **Shuffle up groups and make people talk!** The murderer will get away with it if people aren't getting all sides of the story. As the Game Master, make sure to move people around throughout the acts and ensure that each person gets enough time to cover their bases.
- **Give each player a chance to talk with you privately.** This not only covers up who is the murderer but it gives everyone a chance to ask questions about their character and if they are approaching the game correctly.
- **Push for a group meeting in the second act.** At this point, there's enough information at play to pin the murderer... _if_ people work together on compiling their clues. A group meeting, likely after you've gotten off the train and before you vote, is great for this.
