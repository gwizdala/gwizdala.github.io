# How To Play

A wedding is a sacred event binding the lives of two individuals and their families together. but intertwining the fates of two families, and their secrets, are never that simple.

In *Bridezillas*, you and your party will play as either a HUMAN or a KAIJU. Thing is, you won't know who is who. Can you get hitched without a hitch? Or will those "I Do's" devolve into laser death rays traded between the wedding party?

# Character Selection

## The Party

> ‚úÖ Plan out this section **with the whole group**.

While your character class will be secret to everyone else in your party, it's important to coordinate who is who in relation to the wedding.

Some suggestions for people you can play in your campaign include:

* The **Bride** or **Groom**  
* The **Maid of Honor** or **Bridesmaid**  
* The **Best Man** or **Groomsman**  
* The **Parent** of the Bride or Groom  
* The **Chaplain**  
* The **Flower Child** or **Ring Bearer**

These are merely suggestions - feel free to pick whatever denomination/combination/celebration you and your party like best!

The Game Master in Bridezillas will always be the **Wedding Coordinator** and can play an active role as a character in the story if desired.

## Character Class

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Plan out this section **individually** with your Wedding Coordinator.

Before the game starts, you'll decide if you are a üßë HUMAN or ü¶ñ KAIJU. While **both classes have the primary goal of having a successful wedding**, each class has their own distinct traits and secondary goals. It is important to keep this role secret - **DO NOT TELL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY YOUR CHARACTER CLASS!**

No matter if you're HUMAN or KAIJU, you'll fill out your own NAME, BACKSTORY, PERKS, and WEAKNESS.

### üßë HUMAN

#### Backstory

As a HUMAN, your secondary goal will be to seek out the kaiju. Some backstory examples include:

* You are a monster hunter who heard rumors of kaiju infiltrating human ceremonies  
* You are a kaiju fanatic who's always wanted to meet one up close  
* You don't believe in kaiju and want to prove that they don't exist by showing that everyone *is* a human  
* You find weddings boring and are trying to make this one more interesting

#### Perks

Since you don't know who is and isn't human, it's in your best interest to keep your identity secret. Your PERKS will help you accomplish this and your secondary goal. Pick TWO professions from the PERKS list that your HUMAN has (alternatively, roll 2d20 and pick the corresponding PERK they match with). How these capabilities are interpreted is up to you and the Wedding Coordinator.

**PERKS (AKA Professions): PICK TWO**

{{< column-container wrap="true" >}}
{{< column >}}

1. Artist
2. Athlete
3. Bodybuilder
4. Chef
5. Gymnast

Work with your Wedding Coordinator if you have another idea for a PERK that's not on this list.

### ü¶ñ KAIJU

#### Backstory

As a KAIJU, your secondary goal will be to blend in with the humans during the event. Some backstory examples include:

* You fell in love or are best friends with a human  
* You've always been interested in human culture and wanted to learn more  
* You sense the presence of another Kaiju and are here to defend (or destroy!) the event  
* You were hungry and this seemed like a great way to a quick meal

You will need to pick out a KAIJU NAME and a HUMAN NAME. The HUMAN NAME is what you'll be primarily using during the event unless you are discovered for what you are.

#### Kaiju Type

KAIJU come in many shapes and forms. A great list can be found on the [Godzilla Wiki](https://godzilla-rulers-of-earthland.fandom.com/wiki/Kaiju#Kaiju) but some notable examples include:

* Giant Irradiated Lizard
* Great Divine Moth
* Massive Metaprimatus Ape

At the end of the day, you're a giant creature with extraordinary powers, but at this wedding your goal is to be as human as possible.

#### Perks

Along with your KAIJU TYPE you'll need to pick TWO mutations from the PERKS list that your KAIJU has (alternatively, roll 2d20 and pick the corresponding PERK they match with). How these powers are interpreted is up to you and the Wedding Coordinator.

**PERKS (AKA Mutations): PICK TWO**

# Gameplay

Players need 1d6 to play this game. The Wedding Coordinator needs 2d6 to play.

During the wedding, you'll be asked to make rolls based on what you are trying to do during the ceremony. What your rolls do will be dependent on what you are trying to accomplish and whether or not your identity has been revealed.

Players will always roll a 1d6 to perform an action, otherwise known as a SKILL ROLL. The Wedding Coordinator will roll up to 2d6 additional dice depending on the player and the situation they're in.

Rolls throughout the game are rated as follows:

| Roll | Result |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1-5 | CRITICAL SUCCESS. The action works better than expected |
| 6-8 | SUCCESS. The action works as expected |
| 9-11 | FAILURE. The action doesn't work |
| 12-18 | CRITICAL FAILURE. The action doesn't work in wild way |

The game will progress as follows:

1. **The Beginning/The Secret**: As players, you'll be focused on the wedding and the characters that are a part of it. The Wedding Coordinator will task you with preparing for the ceremony while you'll be covertly trying to resolve your secondary goal. Use this section to understand yourself and the people you're playing with - and try not to get caught as a HUMAN or KAIJU! Rolls are partially concealed during this section.  
2. **The Middle/The Reveal**: At some point you'll all be REVEALED for what you truly are. It may be due to your own actions or due to a cataclysmic event that requires you to perform at your most powerful to save the wedding. Rolls become public during this section for whoever has been REVEALED.  
3. **The End/The Team Up:** When everyone is revealed, you'll need to TEAM UP to conquer the chaos that has ensued during the wedding. Rolls are not only public but you'll be rolling as a team together during this section.

In other words: there are 3 parts to BRIDEZILLAS. Each part will task your players with making SKILL ROLLS but how the final outcomes are determined will depend on the part of the game you're in.

## The Beginning/The Secret

At **The Beginning** of the wedding it is **harder to be a KAIJU**. Once/If identities are revealed, your rolls become much easier.

During the beginning, each player is tasked with fulfilling their wedding duties while also trying to achieve their secondary goal. 

To perform a SKILL ROLL, the player should announce the NUMBER of the PERK they are using and roll a 1d6. The Wedding Coordinator will roll a certain number of dice in secret and add them to your roll for your outcome.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your PERKS secret! **Announce the NUMBER of the PERK only.**

* üßë If the player is HUMAN, the PERK will be used to aid the player in their outcome. If the HUMAN rolls FAILURE or worse, their WEAKNESS will play a part in the failure.  
* ü¶ñ If the player is KAIJU, the PERK will be used against them if the result is FAILURE or worse.

| Player Type | Player Dice Rolled (Public) | Wedding Coordinator Dice Rolled (Secret) | Trait Used in SUCCESS or Better | Trait Used in FAILURE or Worse |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| HUMAN | 1d6 | 1d6 | PERK | WEAKNESS |
| KAIJU | 1d6 | 2d6 | n/a | PERK |

### Example

#### üßë HUMAN

Bill is tasked with pitching the tent for the outdoor ceremony. Bill selects his first PERK "Handy-Person" and announces he is rolling for PERK 1.

* If Bill's outcome is 8 or less, his action will work as intended and his "Handy-Person" PERK will help him pitch the tent.  
  *e.g. "You find a way to pitch the tent using less material. Add 3 tent posts to your inventory"*  
* If Bill's outcome is 9 or greater, his action will not work as intended and his "Overconfident" WEAKNESS will prevent him from successfully pitching the tent.  
  *e.g. "You jumped at it without really knowing what you were doing and somehow caught yourself and the bride in the tent fabric"*

#### ü¶ñ KAIJU

Jane is tasked with pitching the tent for the outdoor ceremony. Jane selects her second PERK "Sword Tail" and announces she is rolling for PERK 2.

* If Jane's outcome is 8 or less, her action will work as intended and she will be able to pitch the tent without incident.  
  *e.g. "You pitched the tent with time to spare. You have another action."*  
* If Jane's outcome is 9 or greater, her action will not work as intended and her "Sword Tail" PERK will prevent her from successfully pitching the tent.  
  *e.g. "You accidentally cut through the fabric of the tent - there's a gaping hole where a door should not be."* 

## The Middle/The Reveal

In **The Middle** of the wedding it is **harder to be a HUMAN**, as the KAIJU will be able to utilize their powers openly.

During **The Middle**, each player will be openly interacting as their character type while still trying to prevent the wedding from falling apart. **Players enter this section individually** and only once REVEALED as stated by the Wedding Coordinator. If desired, a player can REVEAL themselves early but must announce to the Wedding Coordinator that they are doing so.

> ‚úÖ Your abilities are on display! **Announce your PERK when using it.**

üßëü¶ñ For both revealed HUMANS and KAIJU, the PERK will be used to aid the player in their outcome. If the revealed HUMAN or KAIJU rolls FAILURE or worse, their WEAKNESS will play a part in the failure.

| Player Type | Player Dice Rolled (Public) | Wedding Coordinator Dice Rolled (Public) | Trait Used in SUCCESS or Better | Trait Used in FAILURE or Worse |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| HUMAN | 1d6 | 2d6 | PERK | WEAKNESS |
| KAIJU | 1d6 | 1d6 | PERK | WEAKNESS |

If two dice rolled are the same number (e.g. a Double), the **expected outcome occurs with a twist**. The twist can be decided by the Wedding Coordinator or as a group.

### Example

#### üßë HUMAN

Bill attempts to clear the rubble off of the Rabbi. Bill selects and announces he is using his PERK "Bodybuilder".

* If Bill's outcome is 8 or less, his action will work as intended and his "Bodybuilder" PERK will help him lift off the rubble.  
  *e.g. "You tear the rubble off of Rabbi Jackson and pull him to safety."*  
* If Bill's outcome is 9 or greater, his action will not work as intended and his "Overconfident" WEAKNESS will prevent him from successfully lifting off the rubble.  
  *e.g. "This rubble is way harder to lift than you thought - you pull a muscle as a result and Rabbi Jackson is still trapped."*

#### ü¶ñ KAIJU

Guargog attempts to clear the rubble off of the Rabbi. Guargog selects and announces she is using her PERK "Laser Breath".

* If Guargog's outcome is 8 or less, her action will work as intended and her "Laser Breath" PERK will help her clear the rubble.  
  *e.g. "You vaporize the rubble around Rabbi Jackson and pull him to safety."*  
* If Guargog's outcome is 9 or greater, her action will not work as intended and her "Asthmatic" WEAKNESS will prevent her from successfully moving the rubble.  
  *e.g. "The dust from the collapse has worsened your asthma. You cough a cloud of lasers that vaporizes the Maid of Honor."*

## The End/The Team Up

At **The End** of the wedding, HUMANS and KAIJU are the most effective when they **band together**. Whether or not this happens is up to the players. 

The same rules as **The Middle** apply here (including Doubles) with the caveat that players can TAG-TEAM, using their powers combined against a common cause.

To TAG-TEAM, a HUMAN or KAIJU can assist another player by rolling a 1d6 to their applicable SKILL. This player's roll will subtract from the total outcome.

However, **if the TAG-TEAMing player rolls a 2 or 1, their WEAKNESS will be applied as part of the outcome.**

### Example

Guargog attempts to swipe the Giant Mecha-Lizard with her "Sword Tail" PERK. Bill TAG-TEAMS with his "Handy-Person" PERK by strapping cutlery to the tail to make it more effective.

1. Guargog and Bill roll their 1d6s. The Wedding Coordinator rolls 1d6 since the KAIJU initiated the action.  
   The total outcome is (*Guargog's roll + the Wedding Coordinator's roll - Bill's roll)*  
2. If Bill's roll is 2 or 1, Bill's WEAKNESS of "Overconfident" will play into the result regardless of the outcome.

# Running the Game

> ‚õî This section is for **Wedding Coordinators only**.

## The Story

A wedding with Kaiju in it is anything but ordinary. You'll be picking a main SCENARIO that will plague the wedding-goers and a TWIST that will test their skills later in the game. Feel free to pick/roll for any of the SCENARIOS and TWISTS provided below or use them as examples to make your own.

### The Scenario

Pick a SCENARIO that will occur during the wedding. Some examples include:

1. Alien Invaders touch down at the ceremony  
2. An Evil Ex crashes the wedding  
3. An Ancient Evil is awakened on wedding grounds  
4. A Biblically Accurate Angel descends upon the wedding-goers  
5. Government Spies have infiltrated the event  
6. Moon-Nazis  
7. Mecha-Pope despises mixed marriages  
8. A Billionaire Tech-Tycoon wants to sell Kaiju parts online  
9. God is real, and boy are they angry  
10. The Robot uprising begins, and it's all Robot Vacuums

### The Twist

Later in the game the SCENARIO will be supplemented by a TWIST. Some examples include:

1. The Bride/Groom gets cold feet  
2. A Twister touches down at the wedding grounds  
3. An Explosion at the nearby science lab causes all players to switch sizes (i.e. big HUMANS and tiny KAIJU)  
4. The wedding has been taking place in a space station  
   (punctured wall, gravity inversion, lots of possibilities here)  
5. The floor is literally lava  
6. An Earthquake splits the wedding grounds in half  
7. Interdimensional Wizards have come for the Ring  
8. A Meteor threatens another mass extinction event  
9. The Rehearsal Dinner has left the party with a sudden bout of food poisoning  
10. A Solar Eclipse has enshrouded the ceremony in darkness

### How it Plays Out

Gameplay and, as such, your Story is divided into 3 phases. Details regarding progression into each phase and PLAYER EFFECTS are described in the Tracking Progress section.

**The Beginning is your time to focus on the players and the wedding**. Let them try to figure out who each person is while giving them tasks to complete to prep the wedding ceremony.

**The Middle is when you reveal the SCENARIO** . At this point at least one player will be REVEALED and can help aid in preventing the SCENARIO from ruining the wedding. If a player wishes to reveal themselves early they can but must roll PLAYER EFFECT with disadvantage (i.e. roll 2d6 and take the lower result).

**The End is where you reveal the TWIST and then wrap up the SCENARIO**. As players start to tackle the SCENARIO, and are preparing to team up, use the TWIST to mix up their strategy. By the end of the game, the players should have resolved the scenario to the best of their abilities and (hopefully!) successfully completed a very special (and memorable) wedding celebration.

## Tracking Progress

Progress is tracked in two forms: PLAYER EFFECTS, which impact a player's personal progress in the game, and STAGE PROGRESSION, which moves the story along in accordance with how your players are doing.

### Player Effects

PLAYER EFFECTS have the potential to help or harm players as they attempt to salvage the ongoing wedding. 

Have a table that tracks FAILURES per player. It should look something like this:

| Players | *(4 for Player Effect)* |
| :---- | :---- |
| Player 1 | \|\|\|\| |
| Player 2 | \|\|\|\| \|\| |
| Player 3 | \|\| |

Every time a HUMAN or KAIJU rolls a FAILURE or worse, you will mark a tally in the table under the player who rolled. When the NUMBER OF TALLYS OF A PLAYER reaches 4, have them roll their 1d6 and use the following table to determine the effect. Players can have an infinite number of player effects.

{{< md-table "Roll" "Result" >}}
{{< md-tr >}}
{{< md-td >}}

1

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< md-td >}}

The player's powers are out of control! Use the **both** of the player's PERKS against them to the point of CRITICAL FAILURE.

Additionally, roll a 1d6. If the roll is 3 or less, disable one of their PERKS until the next PLAYER EFFECT roll (from any player).

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< /md-tr >}}
{{< md-tr >}}
{{< md-td >}}

2-3

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< md-td >}}

The player's WEAKNESS is magnified. FAILURES are now CRITICAL FAILURES until the next PLAYER EFFECT roll (from any player).

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< /md-tr >}}
{{< md-tr >}}
{{< md-td >}}

4-5

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< md-td >}}

The player's true powers are invoked. The player rolls with advantage until the next PLAYER EFFECT roll.

If the player must roll with disadvantage, the two rolls are nullified.

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< /md-tr >}}
{{< md-tr >}}
{{< md-td >}}

6

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< md-td >}}

Help has arrived! Give the player a tool to help them in the game. Examples include:

* A giant laser sword
* A mech
* A rocket launcher
* A suit of armor
* Nuclear launch codes
* An NPC partner
* A shield generator
* Cybernetic enhancements
* An Kaiju evolution or brand-new player effect

There are plenty of tools online to help you select random tools if you'd like more options, like https://spinthewheel.app/scifi-weapons-arsenal.

How this is delivered to the player is up to you, but should make sense in the context of the SCENARIO.

{{< /md-td >}}
{{< /md-tr >}}
{{< /md-table >}}

If this is the player's first PLAYER EFFECT, additionally REVEAL the player's true character type in the outcome. You do not need to progress the stage when this happens, however this player will now be rolling in accordance with the rules in **The Middle**.

### Stage Progression

There are two suggested ways to progress into the next stage - a WEDDING CLOCK and a TOTAL EFFECT TALLY. The WEDDING CLOCK is most effective when you're looking to **tell a story** as it gives you the most freedom to progress to different sections based on your player's behavior. The TOTAL EFFECT TALLY is **best used as a mechanical fallback** if you need a nudge to move to the next section.

#### Wedding Clock

BRIDEZILLAS takes place over the course of a Wedding Day, and as such has a strict timeline to adhere to. From a Wedding Coordinator perspective, you'll be able to "move along" the story based on how the players are tackling the problems at hand.

Wedding Clocks follow the Progress Clocks paradigm from Blades in the Dark (https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks) and are represented by a circle divided into segments. Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in this clock (think 4 segments is complex, 6 is more complicated, and 8 is daunting). Fill in segments of the clock as players progress through the action.

Your Wedding Clocks may look something like this:  
![Circle Segments Reqpresenting a Wedding Clock](../images/bridezillas-v1/wedding-clock.png)

Consider implementing clocks based on the following actions:

* World progression toward the SCENARIO occurring  
  *e.g. An incoming storm approaches the wedding, carrying with it a swarm of airborne octopi (Track **incoming storm**)*  
* World progression toward the TWIST occurring  
  *e.g. Player movement is damaging the floor of the cruise ship, threatening it to sink (track **ship damage**)*  
* Player progression toward or against their secondary goal  
  *e.g. Guargog is unsuccessfully blending in with the HUMANS (track **KAIJU failure rolls**)*
  *Bill is successfully figuring out who is a KAIJU (track **HUMAN success rolls**)*  
* Wedding Progression  
  *e.g. Wedding preparation, guest arrival, people in position, ring secured, etc.*

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that a clock tracks progress, it doesn't dictate it.

A Wedding Clock reflects the situation so that the group can gauge how they're doing. A clock is like a speedometer in a car - it shows the speed of the vehicle but doesn't determine speed. As the Wedding Coordinator, you and your players have agency to control how fast or slow the game is going.

#### Total Effect Tally

If you and your players need a mechanical nudge to help move the game along that isn't satisfied by the Wedding Clocks, consider counting the total number of player effect tallies (i.e. FAILURE rolls) and progressing the game based on a tally count.

**Total *(3 x #Players to progress)***

| The Beginning (The Secret) | The Middle (The Reveal) | The End (The Team Up) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| \|\|\| \|\|\| \|\|\| | \|\|\| | N/A |

{{<details title="Total Effect Tally Example (Click to Open)">}}

![Total Effect Tally example](../images/bridezillas-v1/total-effect-tally-example.png)

{{</details>}}

When the TOTAL NUMBER OF TALLYS reaches 3x the number of players (e.g. 9 for 3 players, 12 for 4 players, 15 for 5 players, etc.), progress the game to the next phase (i.e. The Beginning ‚Üí The Middle ‚Üí The End).

And of course, this story wouldn't exist without **Nicole** and **Dan**. Your kindness that you share with all of us and each other is something that I truly cherish - I look forward to many more sessions with you both in the future!
