# I like _wearing many hats_.

While my primary focus for the greater part of a decade has been Sales Engineering, during my time at startups I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of different departments and spaces.

I've held roles in Product, Engineering, Sales, Project Management, and UI/UX design (sometimes all at the same time!). I've managed teams and been an individual contributor for others. At one point, I was the lead editor and secondary author of a successful [FDA 510K Submission](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K220090).

# I love _learning something new_ and _teaching people about it_.

While at [Visibly](https://www.govisibly.com/), I wrote all of the public facing [documentation and how-to-guides](https://docs.govisibly.com/). At [Arrive](https://www.arrive.com/) I [did the same thing](https://partners.arrive.com/).

My favorite place to be is when I don't know the answer - it means I have a fun new challenge to overcome. It's even better when I can share that knowledge with others: as a team, we can accomplish anything!

# Where am I now?

Nowadays I work for [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html) as a Sales Engineer. You can see an example of what I'm doing [here](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9491/621294).

Outside of work you can find me traveling, baking, drawing, and researching the latest coffee gadget.
